# Simple-Neural-Network
A perceptron neural network, using machine learning to correctly classify. 

A simple neural network, used to demonstrate supervised learning as part of my undergraduate final project: The Mathematics of Image Processing and Recognition. 

### How it works: 
- Two input neurons, one output. 
  - {Input 1, Input 2, Expected Output}: 
  - {1,1,1}
  - {1,0,1}
  - {0,1,1}
  - {0,0,0}
- Initial random weights, and a bias, are assigned
- Comparing the expected output with the actual, gradient descent is used to make adjustments to weights and bias 
- Loop 5000 times, but can be edited (time dependant)


To be refactored using principles of OOP, and SOLID design. 

_Project will be linked once marking has completed at the University of Lincoln (Late summer 2022)_
