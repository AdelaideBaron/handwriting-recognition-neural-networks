# Mathematics of Image Processing and Recognition 
Final year project for BSc Mathematics at the University of Lincoln, for which I received 80% (first), and a first class honours 

This repository contains the research project, and the small code to supplement it. It is worth noting that coding was not something studied before this project, and focussed more on the mathematics. 

However, I am working on an extension to the project, and developing a neural network further. This ongoing work can be found within 'extension'. 

### Overview of directories and files: 
* Project.pdf - pdf version of the final project. 

_undergraduateProject_: 
* finalProject - all contents of final project Tex file. 
* supportingDocuments - research plan, and sobel poster - referenced in the project. 
* simpleNeuralNetwork - the C++ code used intially in my project.

_extension:_
* ongoing project, building upon the undergraduate project.
